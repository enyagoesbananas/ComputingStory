Time to start with the story shall we?

-Prologue-
Once upon a time, in a village far far away... lived a girl, who's hair was never straight.It looked like the wind was always blowing,and without anyone knowing.
She was ostracized for her looks,and ridiculed for her love of books.
Once a confident girl was now ashamed. Was she pretty, or was she fake?
She avoided going out, and hid in her house, for she thought no one would want to see her.
For ten years she remained like this, learning off of books.
She learnt how to do poetry, and loved her romance books.
She longed for someone to see her that way,like she was their world.
But she knew no one would ever know the girl behind the door,
whose hair flowed like the breeze and hides in her stronghold.

It was another day. She did not know what day it was, she did not need to care. 18 year old Kaylie was staring out the window blankly. She was alone at home again, for her father had gone to work.
She sighed. What was she going to do now? She had done every chore to do in the house; even mopped the floor twice!
She stood up and took her book. It was about time she had to go to the library to borrow and return her books. She hoped she wouldn't be seen, but then again, she hadn't been noticed for 10 years ever since she started staying at home.

She walked along the dark alleyway. No one dared to come here, for they thought some ghost or monster was always lurking in the shadows. She knew it was not true, but it was a good way to avoid people.
She entered the back gate and went in. She tiptoed towards the romance section once again. The books were piling up with dust with the neglect that came over the years, and she dusted off the dust. " Hmm, lets see... ah! Shakespear's Romeo and Juliet!" She'd found her favorite book! She immediately got out her card, and approached the librarian.

"H-hey Miss..."

"Ah! Hi Kaylie. Coming to borrow more books?" the librarian chuckled. "You're such a bookworm. If not for your love of books we would have already closed down." The library was deserted, and nobody came. The boys were always playing football outside, while the girls stayed in to learn how to knit and sew dresses. It was considered as disgraceful if a girl did not know how to do these things, but Kaylie had no care for this. She only liked to learn and read books.
"Y-Yeah..." Kaylie replied, "I've come to borrow this."

The librarian looked at the book cover in surprise. "But Kaylie, you've already read this five times!"
Kaylie didn't look shocked at all. She knew she liked this book long enough to read it a lot of times in a row. "Yeah, it's my favorite." For once she did not stutter.
